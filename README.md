In this html, I have made a program that takes a prerecorded list of people who have attened an event,
help autocomplete when taking attendance, and then separates people to an n number of tables, with a 
group leader present at each table. It is possible to require several people to be at the same table, 
and there are two modes. One only take attendance while the other is able to separate them into tables.
You can take notes on each person marked present and then finnaly export all the data from that event 
onto a spreadsheet. 

Enjoy!!
